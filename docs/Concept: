Concept:
	
	B2C market place for stores and service providers

	Problem Statement:

	Finding the right product or service in a new or unfamiliar location can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience for users. Traditional search methods often require extensive scrolling through listings or rely on users already knowing the name or location of stores. This process becomes even more challenging when searching for niche or specific products.
	--

	At the same time, local store owners face difficulties in showcasing their products and services to nearby customers. Existing platforms often require manual and time-intensive product uploads, making it harder for small businesses to stay competitive and reach their audience effectively.
	--

	There is a lack of a seamless, location-based solution that bridges the gap between customers looking for products and services and store owners trying to market them efficiently.
